## Performance Metrics

**Per the comprehensive guide targets:**
- **Time Savings:** 10-20x faster than manual
  - Manual: 4-8 hours for 100 bills
  - AI: 15-30 minutes for 100 bills
- **Accuracy Target:** 95%+ field extraction
- **Expected:** 95%+ with current GPT-4o implementation

**Actual Performance (estimated):**
- Bill extraction: ~10-15 seconds per document
- Duplicate detection: <1 second for 100 bills
- Rate analysis: <1 second for 100 bills
- Total processing: ~30-60 seconds for typical case (5-10 bills)

## Cost Estimate

**Per Document Processing (10 bill line items):**
- GPT-4o: ~1,500 tokens input + ~800 tokens output
- Cost: ~$0.025 per document
- vs. Manual: $25/hour × 0.5 hours = $12.50
- **Savings: 99.8% cost reduction**

**Expected Usage:**
- 50 billing documents/month: $1.25 AI cost vs. $625 manual cost
- **Total Savings: $623.75/month**
